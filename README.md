# HardDriveReader
Imagine that you have a hard drive without an operating system.
The functionality of this program allows you to travel through the file system using disk reading.
I did this relying on the documentation on the site https://flatcap.github.io/linux-ntfs/ntfs/, as well as on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_of_the_FAT_file_system
I figured out some things on my own, but many things remained unclear.
